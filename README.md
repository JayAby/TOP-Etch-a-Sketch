# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a part of my learning journey with The Odin Project's FOundation Course. The aim of this project is to improve DOM manipulation, Javascript and CSS Skills by recreating a browser based version of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

# Introduction

This project will be built using a 16 x 16 grid of squares which behaves like pixels in a drawing app. Users can change the color of the squares by hovering around them, creating a pixelated drawing effect.

# Features
* 16x16 Grid: The project features a grid of divs generated in javascript to mimic pixels in a drawing app.
* Hover Effect: As the mouse is moved over the grid squares, it changes the colors of the grids, leaving a trail.
* Custom Grid Size: A button that allows user to choose their desired grid size.
* Color Customization: Colors can be randomized on each trail left by the mouse.
